## PeopleJoin

PEOPLEJOIN is a benchmark for evaluating LM-mediated collaborative problem solving. Given a user request, PEOPLEJOIN agents must identify teammates who might be able to assist, converse with these teammates to gather information, and finally compile a useful answer or summary for the original user. PEOPLEJOIN comprises two evaluation domains: PEOPLEJOIN-QA, focused on questions about tabular data, and PEOPLEJOIN-DOCCREATION, focused on document creation tasks. The two domains are adapted from existing NLP benchmarks for database question answering and multi-document summarization; here, however, the information needed to complete these tasks is distributed across synthetic “organizations” of 2–20 users, simulating natural multi-user collaboration scenarios. We implemented several popular LM agent architectures, and report their accuracy and efficiency at completing tasks.


## Setup

### Back-end Server

1. Install Python 3.11.
   One way is to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (for Linux/MacOS) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#quick-start) (for Windows).
   Run `pyenv install --list | grep '^ *3.11' | tail -n1` to discover the most recent minor version of Python 3.11.
   For Windows run `pyenv install --list` and manually check the latest minor version of Python 3.11.
   Run `pyenv install 3.11.X` where `X` is the latest minor version available.
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) 1.5 or later following the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
   On Windows, you can use the following command in Powershell: `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python`.
1. Configure Poetry to use your Python 3.11 installation.
    - If using `pyenv` setup above: run `poetry env use $(pyenv prefix 3.11.X)/bin/python`
    - Otherwise: run `poetry env use <path to your Python 3.11 binary>`
1. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies.
1. Run `poetry shell` to activate the venv.
1. Run `make backend` to start a back-end server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
    - To utilize Make file in Windows, you will have to install make on Windows. One way to do that is through chocolatey.
    - To install chocolatey, run the following command in the administrative PowerShell:
   `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
    - Once installed, restart Powershell and run: `choco install make`. You can verify your installation using `make -v`.
    - You can provide config name such as `make backend AGENT_CONF=src/async_collab/scenarios/people_join_qa/agent_configs/spider_sample.json`


## Experimentation
- Make any changes to the LLM APi interface as needed in `src/async_collab/llm/llm_client_service.py`. 
- See `workspace/` for experiments scripts

## Project structure
- `src/`: Python code for the project.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for code in `src/`.
- `data/`: Releant data files
